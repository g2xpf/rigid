# Rigid Body Simulation (2D)

## Abstract
This sample shows collisions between two types of rigid bodies.
1. Rectangle | Circle
1. Rectangle | Rectangle
1. Circle | Circle

## Method 
This simulation uses [contact clipping](http://www.dyn4j.org/2011/11/contact-points-using-clipping/) for collision detection between two rectangles, 
and [penalty method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_method) for solving constraints.
